# Voice-Controlled-Mobility-Robot
Voice Controlled Mobility Robotâ€“ The application of this is to control the Robot through voice commands, sensors and a joystick .As this is a multi-functional Robot so therefore uses voice recognition module, ultrasonic sensor, and joystick have been integrated in this Robot. In this way we have obtained a Robot which can be driven with voice commands, through joystick and sensors so that to provide the possibility of avoiding the accidents. This project involves voice recognition module which will recognize the voice of the user and process the command of the user and send it to the Arduino. The user has to save the different voice commands in voice recognition module before use it to control the direction of the Robot. Arduino is a microcontroller based board which accepts data. The Arduino board based on the Atmega328 microcontroller processes the data and determines which motor will be activated. User can also change the direction of the wheel chair through joystick, while the sensors will automatically avoid the obstacles.
